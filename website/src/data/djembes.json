            "description": "This lathe turned Indonesian mahogany djembe decorated with Aborigine inspired artwork is an unusual drum. The interior shape is something of a hybrid between the traditional profiles of a djembe and a bougarabou. To emphasise both characteristics, I decided to head this drum with a thick, unshaved calf skin, as would commonly be found on a bougarabou, and tune the drum to a level of tension more commonly found in djembe drums. The result is something quite pleasing to both the ear and the hands. Sharp and responsive to the touch, the slaps and tones are well defined and easy to play, but the sound is noticicably more muted and 'fat' than you'd expect from a djembe.<br><br>I'd recommend this as a perfect drum for studio recording or for an amplified percussionist in a band. However it lacks in volume when compared with other drums of similar size, so this djembe probably isn't best suited to drum circles or other unamplified situations.",
