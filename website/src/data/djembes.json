The tall bowl shape and Djalla wood combination make for a drum with exceptionally sweet tones and very dry slaps."

		"description2": "Unfortunately this djembe has had a small issue with some pesky woodworms, but it's since been fully treated and is now a perfectly serviceable djembe. There were just seven flight holes in total and none of them very deep. The insects are now gone and the holes have all been filled with resin. Nonetheless, £50 has been dropped from the price of this djembe to compensate for the presence of the holes."
